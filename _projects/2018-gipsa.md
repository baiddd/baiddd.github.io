The aim of this project is to characterize inertial sensors such as gyroscopes and accelerometers by identifying parameters in the sensor noise model based on experimental measurements and implementing data pre-processing algorithms to eliminate systematic errors. 

* Conducted experimental easurements using inertial measurement unit (MPU6050) and a microcontroller (Arduino)
* Executed multivariate optimization for accelerometer on Matlab
* Applied Levenberg Marquardt algorithm, Runge-Kutta method, and quaternion transformation for denosing
