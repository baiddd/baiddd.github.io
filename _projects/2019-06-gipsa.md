The goal of this project is to explore the influence of sensory memory on speech motor learning, specifically examining the effects of transient information storage from both somatosensory and auditory inputs. The emphasis is on comprehending how this stored information plays a role in adjusting speech movements based on the outcomes of previous attempts.

Achievements:

- Developed experimental code using Matlab.
- Conducted statistical analysis using R.
- Executed human experiments to gather relevant data.
- Published one paper presenting the findings of the research.
