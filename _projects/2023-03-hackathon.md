The objective of this project is to improve the "Serpentine" binning algorithm for denoising biological images without the need for retraining.

Achievements:

- Adapted and implemented the tool specifically for microscopy images.
- Successfully executed scripts on remote GPU/CPU clusters to enhance computational efficiency.
