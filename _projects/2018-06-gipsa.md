The objective of this project is to characterize inertial sensors, specifically gyroscopes and accelerometers, by identifying parameters within the sensor noise model through experimental measurements. Additionally, the project involves the implementation of data pre-processing algorithms to eliminate systematic errors.

Achievements:

- Conducted experimental measurements using an inertial measurement unit (MPU6050) and a microcontroller (Arduino) to collect relevant data.
- Executed multivariate optimization for accelerometers using Matlab to enhance accuracy.
- Applied advanced techniques such as the Levenberg Marquardt algorithm, Runge-Kutta method, and quaternion transformation for denoising the sensor data, contributing to improved signal quality.
