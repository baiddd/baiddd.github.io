The aim of this project is to investigate the role of sensory memory in speech motor learning by examining the impact of transient information storage derived from both somatosensory and auditory inputs. The focus is on understanding how this stored information contributes to the modification of speech movements in response to the outcomes of prior attempts.

* Developed experimental code (Matlab)
* Conducted statistical analysis (R)
