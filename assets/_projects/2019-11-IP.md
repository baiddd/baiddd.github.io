The aim of this project is to enhance the quality of super-resolution images using deep learning techniques, with the goal of reducing the number of acquired single-molecule images. Accelerating acquisitions could enable high-resolution visualization of biological structures in living cells, particularly dynamic microtubules. 

* Implemented deep learning algorithm for image/video translation (Python, TensorFlow)
* Executed scripts on remote GPU/CPU clusters
* Initiated the application of the vision transformer to harness temporal information
* 1 paper was published, 1 paper is in revision, 1 paper is under preparation
